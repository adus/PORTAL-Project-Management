Priority List (Updated 10/25/17 VAST TSMO)
1. BlueMAC processed API data (In process) 
1. Dynamic segmentation (need to estimate this task) (In process)
1. Fix the “stretching” on the contour plot (In process) 
1. Fix WSDOT Stations that are not showing on the map 
1. BlueMAC raw data import
1. Integrate BlueMac API travel time data into the map (required) (needs estimate) (need to consider integration of STEVE travel times) 
1. Get new transit data loaded  (depends on the data we get from C-TRAN) 
1. Vehicle Length Data integration (needs estimate)
1. Automated import (will not do with ODOT  automated import)
1. WSDOT travel time will be 2018 scope





Outstanding Items List

Arterial:
* BlueMAC processed API data (In process) (1)
* BlueMAC raw data (6)
* Purdue data: Get information on basecamp that decodes enumerations; good for now; purpose was to get that data loading and archived; we are doing that now (Done)
* Add Rob to the PORTAL daily update email list (Complete)

Highways:
* Fix WSDOT Stations that are not showing on the map (4)
* Fix the “stretching” on the contour plot (In process) (3)
* Dynamic segmentation (need to estimate this task) (In process) (2)
* Automated import (can possibly do with ODOT - 3.5)
* TTR for WSDOT:
* Get WSDOT sample of ODOT Travel Time data (get back to Scott by next Tuesday) (Done)
* Understand how difficult it will be to display TTR data in PORTAL if WSDOT can emulate ODOT’s feed (to discuss with Morgan, get back to Scott by next Tuesday) (needs estimate)

Transit
* Get updated C-TRAN data from David C (requested)
* Get data loaded  (depends on the data we get from C-TRAN) (7)
* Have C-TRAN folks review the web site to make sure they are comfortable with it

Longer-Term Requests:
* Integrate BlueMac API travel time data into the map (required) (5) (needs estimate) (Add WSDOT TT?)
* Vehicle Length Data integration (8) (needs estimate)
* GIS data (investigation)

Next year:
* AVL data & publishing the AVL data
