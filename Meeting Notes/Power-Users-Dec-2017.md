# Meeting Notes
## Ramp Report a.k.a. Download All Data Button a.k.a. the Chi Button
**Significant progress made. Small fixes needed: (see AI below)**
1. order by starttime
1. dynamic ramp columns (get rid of blank ramp columns)
1. verify all HOV lanes are working (after meta-import completed)

**Needs labelling for HOV lanes and for detector location (before, in, after gore/merge)**
1. Rich asks about labelling HOV lanes; Chi adds we need info on detector location 
1. Chi suggests we display HOV info and detector location on the two quantity chart page (generally agreed this is a good idea)
1. Kristin suggests we also try to label the HOV columns in the downloaded report
1. Methods are suggested for displaying detector location - text (in, after, before gore) or schematic or point on a map
1. Mike B is working on updated accurate lat/lons for all detectors
1. Decide we need more offline discussion with ODOT and the PORTAL Team (see AI below)

## Washington County Travel Time Data
Preliminary implementation shows Washington county & clark county travel time stations in UI, work needed with Washington County to figure out which project to use and to figure out which projects have data (see AI below)
 
## Tours
**Tours available on the Travel time and corridor ranking pages**
1. generally agreed tours are useful for first time or infrequent users
1. request that tours are semi-transparent (instead of black background)
1. request tour for showing how to use the ramp report / download all data button (see AIs below)

## Automated odot meta-data import. 
This task is progressing well and is expected to be completed prior to the next power users meeting. 

## TriMet Data and Report - Need to connect with TriMet to discuss
1. TriMet daily report requires update data, PORTAL team needs to connect with TriMet to see how to get this data, can follow report generated by Steve Callus (see AI below)
1. Joseph Auth indicates that Hillsboro would be interested in transit daily travel times

## Work for next month
1. Work on the items discussed in meeting - items listed below
1. Investigate options for data availability - Task 3A and report to group

## Action Items
1. Complete Small fixes for Download All Data Button
1. Work with ODOT (Chi, Chad, Mike) to get information about HOV lanes and detector location in the ODOT feed; then work to make a plan to get that data into the PORTAL UI; include Mike's updated lat/lons in this discussion
1. Work with Washington County to understand which BlueMAC projects to pull from and which of those projects have data
1. Investigate if tours can be made semi-transparent so can see the web page underneath
1. Create tour or tours for the stations page - show how to get to the download all data button
1. Work with TriMet to get updated data
1. Suggest ideas for data availability (Task 3A in scope)
