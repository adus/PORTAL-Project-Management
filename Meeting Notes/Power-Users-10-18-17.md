Meeting Summary: We demonstrated and discussed new pages on the PORTAL web site. All items that were discussed last meeting are now available on the demo site. In addition, the research into arterial signals not being displayed on the web site and the missing highway stations are complete (see details below). Finally, we spent discussed how to report Ramp data in the PORTAL UI.

Feedback Request: There are three new/updated pages on the demo site - Travel Time, Corridor Ranking and the daily report under Transit (new). We are particularly looking for feedback on the Travel time and Corridor Ranking pages. I'm sending this email to you to ask you to look at these pages and send us feedback. Feedback can be sent email or through the feedback form on the web site. Feedback will be discussed at next month's meeting and will requests for modifications to these pages will be put into the "backlog" then.

Research Results: Some arterial signals are not displaying on the detector health page because the detector health page does not show signals that are not reporting issues. Highway stations are missing due to lack of automated "inventory import." Group decided that automated inventory import is high priority.

Ramp Meter Report: Report should be reconfigured to have columns: Volume (L1, L2, L3, Total); Speed (L1, L2, L3, Average); Occupancy can be optional - no one seems to use occupancy (but I'm sure some researcher will want it). We also need to add a header to the report that indicates if the detector is a loop or radar and the "location" of the detector.

GitHub Tracking: We are tracking all of the requests, projects, etc. using GitHub Projects. If you'd like access to our github projects page, please let me know.
