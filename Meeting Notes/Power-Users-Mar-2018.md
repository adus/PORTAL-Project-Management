**From February Meeting:**
(Updates as of March Meeting below)
Good Morning All -

In light of the weather and closures, I'm going to cancel today's power user's meeting. 

Updates: 
- the travel time page has been updated so that stations from Washington (and Clark County) show on the map, we're working with Washington County to get the data for those stations, but you can see the dots on the map now. _March Update:_ Have been able to fetch Clark County data; working on WA County - will use existing projects; on list for next week.

- final updates to the automated update of ODOT station data have been completed, all ODOT stations should now appear on both the live and demo sites and new stations should automatically appear on both sites, let us know if not. _March Update:_ Was running automatically, but we ran into some issues with updates happening more frequently than we expected and mileposts not as expected. To be discussed at March meeeting.

- tours are transparent (visible on the demo site)

- updates to the download all data button to make timezone in local time have been completed and should be visible on both sites 

- data download page is in the process of being moved to the new framework; the code for this change has been implemented, we are testing and refining internally, so the new page is not yet visible on the demo or live sites. _March Update:_ Is functional for highway data, but not other data sources, priority to be discussed.

- data availability for travel time is also in the process of being implemented, as with data download page; the code has been implemented, but we are testing internally and the new work is not yet visible on demo or live sites. _March Update:_ Will be demonstrated today.

- for next month, the plan is to continue working on Washington County data, continue the data download page and data availability work and begin work on putting the freight stations on a map. _March Update:_ data availability and freight map to be demoed today, WA County data, download in process

Please let me know if you have any questions and enjoy the extra time back in your day.
